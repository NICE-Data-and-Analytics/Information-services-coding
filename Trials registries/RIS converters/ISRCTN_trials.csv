Individual groups and clinicians must not publish data concerning their participants that are directly relevant to questions posed by the study until the TMG has published its report. The TMG (including PPI members) will form the basis of the Writing Committee and will advise on the nature of all publications. There are expected to be a number of resulting publications and the authorship will vary for each. Individual authors are likely to include relevant members of the TMG and collaborators, as well as high-recruiting Investigators. All participating centres and corresponding PIs and co-PIs in the relevant cohort will be acknowledged in all relevant publications, along with members of the IDMC and TSC. The extensive PPI membership of REFINE will help shape and publicise the findings of the trial. This will include via NCRI and cancer specific charity communication channels reflecting the expertise of the PPI representatives. Results from the primary analyses of the different tumour site-specific studies may be available at different times, as will results from the sub-studies. In order not to jeopardise the integrity of the ongoing trials, careful consideration (in discussion with the IDMC and TSC, as appropriate) will be given to the data to be released from each analysis for presentation/publication. Similarly, if at any point it is felt to be justified and appropriate to release specific data from an interim analysis, this would require discussion and agreement from the IDMC, who would be asked to provide guidance regarding the data to be released and how widely they should be disseminated.",Available on request,,2022 Protocol article in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36519749/ (added 16/12/2022),JP Moulton Charity Trust; Medical Research Council,University College London,United Kingdom,England,https://ror.org/02jx3x895,http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265,01/05/2027,19/10/2021,25/05/2026,25/05/2022,25/05/2025,04/07/2023,27/07/2022,Ongoing,Recruiting,Retrospectively registered,2021-002060-47,298208,NCT04913025,Randomized phase II multi-stage multi-arm basket trial,Interventional,Treatment of multiple cancer types which are local advanced or metastatic using immune checkpoint inhibition therapies in adult patients already receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors,Cancer,,government organisation,University/education,Randomised controlled trial,Hospital,Treatment,Drug,,"Ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab",Phase II,Patient,Adult,18 Years,,Both,360,,,,,,,,https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/refine/,,,,,,,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36519749/,ISRCTN79455488_PROTOCOL_ v5.0_03Jan23.pdf (https://www.isrctn.com/editorial/retrieveFile/fcbc8b49-c115-4606-b906-27b2a357e839/41885),,,,,,,
